This folder is intended to store "obfuscated adaptations" of certain 3rd-party libraries.

As a big fat rule of thumb, "obfuscated adaptations" will inherit the license of the original library-being-adapted. 

In addition to providing an "obfuscated option", they're also likely to include constexpr-friendly versions of the relevant functions (such as constexpr-friendly cryptography, as well as whitebox-cryptography, in tls/ subproject).
