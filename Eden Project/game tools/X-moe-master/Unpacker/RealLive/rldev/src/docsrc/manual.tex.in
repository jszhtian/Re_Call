A number of people have been of great help to me in my efforts to understand and 
document the \reallive\ system: Jagarl, on whose \opus{scn2kdump} utility, now 
developed into \opus{xclannad}, I built much of my work; roxfan, whose 
additional reverse-engineering work has revealed the details of the DLL plugin 
system and many other built-in functions and functionality; and, not least, the 
careless programmers of \reallive\ games themselves, whose consistent and 
inexplicable failure to remove vast quantities of debugging code from their 
software on release has been \emph{extremely} enlightening.

My thanks are also due to those users who have contributed in various ways to 
\package's development: Ed Keyes of insani, who tested an earlier version to its 
limits with \opus{Planetarian}, also generously giving permission for me to 
incorporate his \file{g00} compression code into \converter; 258-shi, whose 
introduction of \package\ to a large userbase uncovered numerous bugs; MetaFX, 
who helped develop the Chinese support, and Arte, who helped with Korean 
support; and Soulfang, my first user, without whose request the program might 
never have become anything more than a toy.

The \package\ package provides tools for manipulating the data used by the 
\vas\ \reallive\ virtual machine.\footnote{I use the term \reallive\ to cover 
the whole current-generation interpreter series from \vas. Version 1.0 was 
called \avgns; the name was changed to \reallive\ around version 1.0.0.8.}

Since the actual language used by the developers of these games is undocumented, 
a simple programming language of my own design, called `Kepago', is used 
instead.  The present implementation is rather basic, but higher-level features 
will be introduced in future versions.  Anyone who has used my older Kpac 
package (a similar unofficial development kit for the AVG32 virtual machine) 
will find much here familiar, including many of the function names, although 
they will doubtless miss the sophistication of that rather more mature Kepago 
implementation.

\package\ was designed and written to make a \opus{Clannad} translation
possible, and extended to support Insani's work on \opus{Planetarian} and my own
on \opus{Kanon} when the \reallive\ edition of the latter was released; it has
never been intended to supercede other free visual novel development systems
(most of which are easier to use and come with fewer restrictions), and it is
certainly not intended to replace the official \vas\ toolkit, if you're
considering licensing the \reallive\ engine. In short, I hope this toolkit is
useful, but I make no apology if the programs have any deficiencies,
inaccuracies, inadequacies, or inconsistencies.  You have the source code: as
the sage advises, ``\textit{quicumque melior potest faceret}''.
